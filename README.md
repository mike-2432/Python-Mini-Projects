# Python Mini Projects


#### About
The goal was the create a couple of relatively simple games / simulations that get increasingly more complex. The main purpose was to practice with Python and basic game development.

#### 1: Gravity and Collision
The first application randomly creates a list of balls with different colors from the ball class. They bounce around against each other and change color after collision. It project taught me to code basic gravity and collisions 

#### 2: Gravitational Force Simulation
The second application taught me to code more advanced physics. The application randomly creates a list of particles of different sizes from the particle class. All particles are attracted to each other. The strength of the gravitational force between all particles is based on the mass of the particles and is calculated with the universal gravitational force formula.

#### 3: Pong
The third application is a version of pong where you play against the computer and have to clear a couple of stages that get increasingly more difficult.

#### 4: Minesweeper
The final application is a version of minesweeper. Instead of numbers, the application uses different colors as an indication of the amount of neighboring bombs.
